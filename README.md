For Windows users:
------------------

To access Hadoop running on Linux from Windows client you need a very minimal local Hadoop install.

Download [http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/hdp-win-alpha/winutils.exe](http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/hdp-win-alpha/winutils.exe) 

Place it in a bin directory under a Hadoop directory (C:\Hadoop\bin)

Then use: java -D"hadoop.home.dir=C:\Hadoop" -jar â€¦

Tested the following demos on Windows 8.1:

* boot-ingest
* batch-hive2
* batch-spark
